# Tours-and-Travels-page

Description:

This project, developed using PHP and MySQL, is designed to provide comprehensive information about vehicles available for tours. It caters to two types of users: customers and travel agency employees.

Customer Interaction:

Customers visit the website and input their travel details, including the start and end locations and the desired travel date.
